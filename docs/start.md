# Start

This is a quick start guide to Pt, a study of point, form, and space which is also an experimental
javascript library.

There are many great graphics libraries, such as [processing](http://processing.org), [d3.js](http://d3js.org),
[paper.js](http://paperjs.org), [three.js](http://threejs.org), and many others,
all of which are awesome and performant. In comparison, Pt is experimental (and fun) and focus more on
conceptual thinking. You can read more about the motivations here.
