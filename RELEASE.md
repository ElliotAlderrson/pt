# Release notes

## v0.1 [experimental]
> The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.  
> -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez

**What's new**
- The first release of Pt include a core set of classes based on Point, Form, and Space. 
- A couple of extended classes are in progress
- Draft of supporting documentations and demos

**What's missing**
- In this version we only provides `CanvasSpace` and `Form` to support html5 canvas drawing. 
We would want to get to other forms of expressions, such as DOM or SVG or even something more experimental like Sound.
- For canvas drawing, current release only supports 2D graphics for the most part. 
Needs some more thinking on the approach to 3D.
- Rough build system and unit tests. To be improved.
